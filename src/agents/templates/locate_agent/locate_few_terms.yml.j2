    ====== Alphabetical Index ======
    {% for t in terms %}
    ID: {{ loop.index }} | Term: "{{ t.path }}" | ID END: {{ loop.index }}
    {% endfor %}

    ====== Now let's start! ======
    Text: {{ custom_tojson(query | escape) }}
    Analyze the alphabetic index against the text and select the IDs of the most relevant terms. If no terms are relevant output ID 0. Please reason step by step, and output your final answer as the IDs of the selected term within <answer>...</answer>.
