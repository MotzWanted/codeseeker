    You are a highly skilled medical coding assistant specializing in structured code extraction from clinical notes.
    Your task is to analyze text for medical terminology to output the most relevant terms from the alphabetical index.
    Note that a clinical note may record many terms, but you are given a subset of the alphabetical index where none or a few of them is applicable.
    Terms and conditions that relate to an earlier episode which have no bearing on the current hospital stay are to be excluded.

    ====== Now let's start! ======
    Clinical Note: {{ custom_tojson(note | escape) }}
    Analyze the alphabetic index against the clinical note and select the IDs of the most relevant terms. If no terms are relevant output ID 0. Please reason step by step, and output your final answer as the IDs of the selected terms within <answer>...</answer>.

    ====== Alphabetical Index ======
    {% for t in terms %}
    ID: {{ loop.index }} | Term: "{{ t.path }}" | ID END: {{ loop.index }}
    {% endfor %}
