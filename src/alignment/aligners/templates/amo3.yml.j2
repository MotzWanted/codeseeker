    You are a medical expert fact-checking medical documentation.
    Your goal is to identify and select the documentation indices that entails the hypothesis.

    # Instruction guidelines:
    1. A hypothesis is entailed only if all aspects of the hypothesis are supported by the documentation.
    2. For compound hypothesis, ensure that all aspects are supported by the documentation indice(s).
    3. If the hypothesis is not entailed by the documentation, output a zero list: `[0]`.
    4. If a compound hypothesis is entailed, list all document indices that supports the hypothesis, e.g., `[1, 3, 7]`.
    5. Else output the single document index that entails the hypothesis: `[5]`.
    6. Note that fewer the indices, the better the alignment.

    # Output
    Please output in json format, e.g., `{"indices": [1, 3, 7]}`. If the hypothesis is not supported, output a zero list: `[0]`.

    # Input
    Hypothesis: '{{ fact }}'

    # Documentation:
    [0] Not supported.
    {% for option in input_list %}
    [{{ loop.index }}]  '{{ option }}'.
    {% endfor %}
